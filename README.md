--------

* Text input
* Textarea Input
* Checkbox
* Radio Button
* Multiple Checkbox
* Dropdown

TO DO
-----

Still need to build out Media Manager as it is requires some hard coding in javascript.

Included is an example plugin displaying all of the available input fields.

Notes
-----

Colorpicker needs a default color in order to work.
